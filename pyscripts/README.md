# PYSCRIPTS

This folder contains the python scripts used for plotting the h5 data. Each script contains a loose description of what each produced plot represents.

The folder also includes a series of h5 files containing the I3 data. Each is identified by the processing level (Det,L1,L2...) 
the data was pulled from alongside the method of simulated injection (volume, ranged).
