# figures

This folder contains a series of figures produced by the scripts in 'pyscripts'.

## energyeff_volume.png

This plot measures how efficiently incoming neutrino energies carry over 
between processing levels. The volume injection was used for this example.

## eventcounts_volume.pmg

This plot measures how efficiently the dimuon events carry over bewteen
processing levels. The volume injection was used for this example.

## level_weights.png

This plot is a 1D histogram of the incoming neutrino energy, it is weighted by the dimuon event rate.
There are multiple series, each representing a different level of processing.

## muons.png

This plot represents the secondary outgoing muon energy as a function
of the primary outgoing muon energy. The colormap indicates the dimuon event rate.

## nuenergy_angle_normalized_2dhistogram.png

This plot represents the angle between the two outgoing muon tracks as a function
of the incoming neutrino energy. The histogram is column normalized, such that the sum of all values
in each column equates to 1.

## nuenergy_angle_weighted_2dhistogram.png

This plot represents the angle between the two outgoing muon tracks as a function
of the incoming neutrino energy. The histogram includes a segmented line that represents the median for each bin.
The colormap indicates the dimuon event rate.
